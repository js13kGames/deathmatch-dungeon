# Deathmatch Dungeon

Deathmatch Dungeon is a game written in JavaScript and made for the 2022 edition of the [js13kGames Competition](http://js13kgames.com/) entered into the Desktop and Server categories.

## Gameplay

Deathmatch Dungeon is a multiplayer game in the classic deathmatch tradition in a pixel art style.

The aim is to kill as many opponents as you can in a three minute timed round whilst dying as few times as possible.

A new round will start as soon as there are at least two players in the dungeon.

Pick up scrolls to get a random, different magical ability. Collect potions to restore health.

You will need someone to play against but you can explore the dungeon without.
